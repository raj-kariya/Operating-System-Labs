# Operating-System-Labs
# Page-Replacement-Algorithms-Simulation-Comparision
In this project different Page Replacement Algorithms of Operating System is simulated in table form and we find compare this 3 algorithm by finding the hit and fault rates which tells that OPT is best.  
# Algorithms :
First In First Out(FIFO) \
Least Recently Used(LRU) \
 Optimal Page replacement(OPT) \
# Description(OS Lab 9): 
i. Enter the refference string without any spaces then press "SIMULATE" button. \
ii. First enter the no. of Frames availabe. \
